As an employee, you generally don't have to worry about government paperwork and compliance filings.
Maybe a few hours at tax time, but nothing compared to your employer.

For those of us who have never had a permanent home - renters, those of a vanning persuasion, ship mates - 
we have always been on the short end of the stick when it comes to interacting with institutions. The ever 
present "your address isn't valid" frustration. For those of you newly minted employed vagabonds: your address means 
quite a bit and that makes a world of difference to your employer.

You may receive notices from your employer like - "you may work internationally for up to one month" or "as long 
as you stay within your original employment state" - this is because permanently moving or working in different 
province, state, or country for an extended time is a big compliance headache for your employer. Don't become a 
headache! You'll get cut.

If an employer has a permanent employee in a region, the employer will have to create a local entity or utilize 
the services of an [Employer of Record](https://boundlesshq.com/blog/employment/what-is-an-employer-of-record/)
to be in compliance with government regulations because of you, the employee.

Our suggestion: use a virtual mailbox service to make things easy for your employer by maintaining an address 
in your original employment location. Services like [Anytime Mailbox]({{ site.program.business.anytimemb }}),
[iPostal1]({{ site.program.business.ipostal1 }}), USPS PO Boxes with
[informed delivery](https://www.usps.com/manage/informed-delivery.htm) +
[real street address](https://postalpro.usps.com/PBSA) - can be used depending
on how you plan to remote work. Just be sure that your 
final address isn't flagged as a [Commercial Mailing Receiving Agency](https://www.smarty.com/docs/cmra)
using the [USPS's address lookup tool](https://tools.usps.com/zip-code-lookup.htm?byaddress) if using a US address.

Need help? We provide advice on the setup or can receive and forward your mail.
