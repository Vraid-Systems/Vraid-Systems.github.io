> The long-term and medium-term outlook is still bearish as the trend continues to remain a downtrend. The short-term outlook is considered neutral to bullish. This is because the price on the daily chart has the potential to oscillate within the horizontal range that lies between 160.62 and 180.75. ETH-USD also has a good chance of breaking above the channel, which could allow price to go all the way up to 381.90 where the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level lies.
